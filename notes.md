## Good Design
- Good designs are hard because we don't have a human prediction method
- Impossible to come up with all possible scenerio 
- Another reason is that the UI are not standardlize - the user has to re-learn a new UI on a new platform
- Poor design can results in injuries, bad reviews, more product training, decrease in sales  
- Waterfall and user-centered design methods (be able to compare and contrast)
- Waterfall cycle : Requirements analysis <-> design <-> code <-> test <-> matainence 
- User-centered : see L01-p18
- Functional, usability, and user experience requirements—be able to formulate these correctly from user’s perspective; know the differences between them
- Functionality requirements : what should the user accomplihed from your software. 
-- ex: user must be able to set up an appointment 
- Usability requirements : Establish user performance goal for your software
-- # or errors, task completion time , safety metrics, time to learn, how long remembered ocne learned 
-- ex: user must be able to set up an appointment in 20 sec
- User Experience requirements : Establish a user subjective experience goal
-- subjective experience metric : easy to use, fun, enjoyable, entertaining, rewarding, helpful, motivating, confident 
-- example: on the scale from 1-5 user must rate the system 4
- How to produce a good design?
-- have a growth mindset instead of fixed 
-- get better by doing
