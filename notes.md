## Good Design
- Good designs are hard because we don't have a human prediction method
- Impossible to come up with all possible scenerio 
- Another reason is that the UI are not standardlize - the user has to re-learn a new UI on a new platform
- Poor design can results in injuries, bad reviews, more product training, decrease in sales  
- Waterfall and user-centered design methods (be able to compare and contrast)
- Waterfall cycle : Requirements analysis <-> design <-> code <-> test <-> matainence 
- User-centered : see L01-p18
- Functional, usability, and user experience requirements—be able to formulate these correctly from user’s perspective; know the differences between them
- Functionality requirements : what should the user accomplihed from your software. 
-- ex: user must be able to set up an appointment 
- Usability requirements : Establish user performance goal for your software
-- # or errors, task completion time , safety metrics, time to learn, how long remembered ocne learned 
-- ex: user must be able to set up an appointment in 20 sec
- User Experience requirements : Establish a user subjective experience goal
-- subjective experience metric : easy to use, fun, enjoyable, entertaining, rewarding, helpful, motivating, confident 
-- example: on the scale from 1-5 user must rate the system 4
- How to produce a good design?
-- have a growth mindset instead of fixed 
-- get better by doing 

## L02 - Norman Concepts
- Design concepts are generalize abstractions - these are derived from theory-base knowledge, experience and common sense 
- affordance - An affordance is the possibility of an action on an object or environment.  Afforance is the relationship the agent has with the object and not the object properties 
- Signifiers - where the action should take place (labels, markers, sounds or other perceivable indicator)
- Mapping - the relationship between a control and its effect in the real world 
- Feedback - is about sending back information about what action has been done and what has been accomplished, allowing the person to continue with the activity. Various kinds of feedback are available for interaction design-audio, tactile, verbal, and combinations of these.
- Conceptual model - is the mental model a person forms that relates their interaction with an interface to the underlying thing the interface controls. It is the explanatory framework a person has to explain how a control operates something.
- Visibility – The more visible functions are, the more likely users will be able to know what to do next. Incontrast, when functions are "out of sight," it makes them more difficult to find and know how to use.
- Consistency – This refers to designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks.

## L03 
- Constraints : Physical, Cultural, Semantics, Logical 
- Physical : There is only one possible solution 
- Cultural : Imagine facing the wall in an elevator 
- Semantics: What is the meaning of the situtation.  When you sit in the car, you would face forward for backward 
- Logical : When all peices fit - the only one left should go to the only remaining spot 
- Cultural norms: 
- Transfer effects: Prior experience influences what functionality we expect for an object and how we operate an object
